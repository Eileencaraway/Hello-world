# Hello-world-
this is the readme file of hello world repository
I take this course to learn github step by step 
I found most of the language and game confuse me, the major reason is normally I didn't pay enough attention to learn how to 
walk and listen to "teachers" word. but try to run by myself and thought this can be faster.
