# Hello-world
this is the readme file of hello world repository
I take this course to learn github step by step 
I found most of the language and game confuse me, the major reason is normally I didn't pay enough attention to learn how to 
walk and listen to "teachers" word. but try to run by myself and thought this can be faster. 


ï¼ƒthis is the second line of daily 
I am overwhelmed by the phd period. 
It is no longer about study courses and get a good score. 
and maybe I was lost in University. 
I didn't learn enough knowledge from that. 
One thing I know is , I acutually good at get to know people, make new friend. talk with different people. 
that's one talent. 
I learn to make friend with certain number of people and manage your social in another way. 
try to make life simple
