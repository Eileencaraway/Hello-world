# Hello-world-
this is the readme file of hello world repository
I take this course to learn github step by step 
I found most of the language and game confuse me, the major reason is normally I didn't pay enough attention to learn how to

I am overwhelmed by the phd period. 
it is not longer study courses. 
and maybe even I was lost in University 
I didn't learn enough knowledge from that. 
One thing I know is , I acutually good at get to know people, make new friend. talk with different people. 
that's one talent.
