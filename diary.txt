boen is right in a lot of case. for example, it is indeed I want to many so that I got tired and hard to be satisfied.

in this part, I shouldn't feel don't want to talk with people, don't want to meet with people, don't want to have lunch with 
my colleague. one way to face it, is push yourself a little bit or get used to a routine. 

if the person is indeed what I like, then I would like to talk with them, then I will be happy to say hi to them. 
if I don't like the person, or I don't want to talk with this person at the moment. I can pretend I don't know this people. 
listen to your heart.
