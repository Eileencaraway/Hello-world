boen is right in a lot of case. for example, it is indeed I want to many so that I got tired soon and very hard to be satisfied. 
now, I am in a good office, has nice professor. my research has a little progress. 

#about friend
in this part, I shouldn't feel that I want to avoid people, don't want to meet with people, don't want to have lunch with 
my colleague. one way to face it, is push yourself a little bit or get used to a routine. 
(I think at that time, it is probably because the environment, not only because of myself but also due to other people's character. now this thing change because of yanwei and sudir)

if the person is indeed what I like, then I would like to talk with them, then I will be happy to say hi to them. 
if I don't like the person, or I don't want to talk with this person at the moment. I can pretend I don't know this people. 
listen to your heart.

I am not so good. but I am also not that bad. 
you need to consider I change my reseach area. 
another thing is my own mistake, I prepare myself to be a experiment scientist 
but I end up in depend on programming and theoritical. Program is not too bad. but theory...
anyway, I choose my research group out of for love of physics and maybe it is the most simple physics I can find
and your SMART program, I just need to work harder. meet people. learn to talk with big bosses. 
a long way to go. I believe you can end up good enough.
